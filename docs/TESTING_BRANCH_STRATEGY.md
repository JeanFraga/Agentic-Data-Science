# 🧪 Agent SDK Testing Branch Strategy

## Branch: `feature/agent-sdk-testing`

This branch contains the complete Agent SDK implementation with GitHub-based deployment, safely isolated from the main branch to prevent automatic deployment during testing.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Safe Testing**: Test Agent SDK functionality without triggering production deployment
- **Code Review**: Allow team review before merging to main
- **Iterative Development**: Make adjustments based on testing feedback
- **Documentation Validation**: Ensure all documentation is accurate

## 📋 What's Included in This Branch

### 🔄 **GitHub-Based Deployment**
- Updated Cloud Function configuration for repository source
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow (won't trigger on this branch)
- Removed local zip file dependencies
- Dynamic service account references

### 🤖 **Agent SDK Implementation**
- Natural language to SQL conversion using Gemini AI
- BigQuery ML model creation from descriptions
- HTTP API endpoints for web integration
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 🌐 **Streamlit Web Interface**
- Interactive dashboard for natural language queries
- ML model creation wizard
- SQL execution environment
- Analytics visualizations with Plotly

### 📁 **New File Structure**
```
cloud_function_src/        # Function source (moved from terraform/function/)
├── main.py               # Enhanced with Agent SDK
└── requirements.txt      # Added AI/ML dependencies

agent_sdk_ui/             # Streamlit web interface
├── app.py               # Interactive dashboard
├── requirements.txt     # UI dependencies
└── launch.ps1           # Launch script

docs/                     # Updated documentation
├── AGENT_SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
└── QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
```

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### 1. **Local Testing**
```powershell
# Test Streamlit UI locally
cd "agent_sdk_ui"
.\launch.ps1

# Manual function testing (if needed)
cd "cloud_function_src"
functions-framework --target=main --port=8080
```

### 2. **Branch-Based Testing**
- GitHub Actions won't trigger on feature branches
- Safe to push multiple commits for testing
- Can create PR when ready for review

### 3. **Manual Deployment Testing** (Optional)
```bash
# Deploy to test environment manually
gcloud functions deploy agent-sdk-test \
  --source=./cloud_function_src \
  --entry-point=main \
  --runtime=python311 \
  --trigger-http
```

## 🔄 Branch Management

### Current Status
- ✅ Feature branch created: `feature/agent-sdk-testing`
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed
- ✅ No automatic deployment triggered
- ✅ Ready for testing and iteration

### Next Steps
1. **Test locally** with Streamlit interface
2. **Validate** Agent SDK functionality
3. **Make adjustments** if needed (commit to this branch)
4. **Create Pull Request** when ready for production
5. **Merge to main** to trigger automatic deployment

### Merge Strategy
```bash
# When ready for production:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/agent-sdk-testing
git push origin main  # This will trigger GitHub Actions deployment
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### GitHub Actions Behavior
- **Feature branches**: No automatic deployment
- **Main branch**: Automatic deployment on push
- **PR creation**: Will show deployment preview in checks

### Environment Variables
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is added to GitHub Secrets before merging
- Test with actual API key in local environment first

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Streamlit UI launches successfully
- [ ] Natural language queries work with test data
- [ ] ML model creation generates valid SQL
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete

## 🎉 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Risk-Free Testing**: No accidental production deployments
2. **Iterative Development**: Easy to make and test changes
3. **Team Collaboration**: Others can review code before production
4. **Documentation Verification**: Validate guides before users see them
5. **Rollback Safety**: Main branch remains stable during testing

## 🚀 Ready for Testing!

The Agent SDK implementation is now safely contained in the `feature/agent-sdk-testing` branch. You can test all functionality without affecting production deployments.

**Happy testing! 🧪✨**
