## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **GitHub-Based Deployment**
- ✅ Updated Cloud Function to use GitHub repository source instead of local zip files
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- ✅ Removed storage bucket dependencies for function source code
- ✅ Dynamic service account references (no more hardcoded project IDs)

### 2. **Agent SDK Natural Language ML**
- ✅ Natural language to SQL query conversion using Gemini AI
- ✅ Automatic BigQuery ML model creation from descriptions
- ✅ SQL query execution with formatted results
- ✅ Dataset schema introspection and analysis

### 3. **Dual Function Architecture**
- ✅ **Event-Triggered Function**: `titanic-data-loader` (Storage events)
- ✅ **HTTP API Function**: `agent-sdk-api` (Web interface endpoints)

### 4. **Streamlit Web Interface**
- ✅ Interactive natural language query interface
- ✅ ML model creation wizard
- ✅ SQL execution environment
- ✅ Analytics dashboard with visualizations
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI with Plotly charts

## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets Required:
```bash
GCP_PROJECT_ID          # Your Google Cloud Project ID
GCP_SA_KEY             # Service account JSON key
GEMINI_API_KEY         # Google Gemini API key for AI features
```

### Terraform Variables:
```hcl
variable "gemini_api_key" {
  description = "Google Gemini API key for natural language processing"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The HTTP Cloud Function exposes these endpoints:

### Health Check
```bash
GET /agent-sdk-api?endpoint=health
```

### Natural Language Query
```bash
POST /agent-sdk-api?endpoint=natural_language_query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "How many passengers survived on the Titanic?",
  "dataset_id": "test_dataset"
}
```

### Create ML Model
```bash
POST /agent-sdk-api?endpoint=create_ml_model
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Create a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival",
  "dataset_id": "test_dataset"
}
```

### Execute SQL
```bash
POST /agent-sdk-api?endpoint=execute_query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sql_query": "SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table` LIMIT 10"
}
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd terraform
terraform apply
```

### 2. Set GitHub Secrets
- Add `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_SA_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` to repository secrets

### 3. Deploy Functions
- Push code to main branch to trigger GitHub Actions deployment

### 4. Launch Web Interface
```powershell
cd "h:\My Drive\Github\Agentic Data Science\agent_sdk_ui"
.\launch.ps1
```

### 5. Start Analyzing Data
1. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
2. Configure the Cloud Function URL in the sidebar
3. Ask questions in natural language
4. Create ML models with descriptions
5. Explore the analytics dashboard

## 🔮 Example Use Cases

### Natural Language Queries:
- "How many passengers survived on the Titanic?"
- "What was the average age of passengers by class?"
- "Show me the survival rate by gender and class"

### ML Model Creation:
- "Create a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival based on age, gender, and class"
- "Build a clustering model to group passengers by their characteristics"
- "Create a linear regression model to predict passenger fare"

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Dynamic service account references (no hardcoded IDs)
- ✅ Sensitive variables marked as `sensitive = true`
- ✅ API key stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ CORS headers for secure web interface access
- ✅ Input validation and error handling

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- Cloud Function logs in Google Cloud Console
