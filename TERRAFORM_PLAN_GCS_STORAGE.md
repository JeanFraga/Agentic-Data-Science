# Terraform Plan Management with GCS Storage 📋

**Date:** May 24, 2025  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅  
**Issue Resolved:** tfplan files now stored securely in GCS buckets instead of locally

## Why Store tfplan in GCS Buckets?

### 🚫 **Problems with Local tfplan Storage:**
- **Security Risk**: Plan files contain sensitive infrastructure details
- **No Collaboration**: Team members can't access or review plans
- **No Audit Trail**: No history of what changes were planned/applied
- **CI/CD Issues**: Plans created on one machine can't be applied on another
- **No Backup**: Local files can be lost or corrupted

### ✅ **Benefits of GCS Storage:**
- **Centralized Access**: Team members can download and review plans
- **Security**: Encrypted storage with IAM access controls
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of plans with versioning
- **CI/CD Ready**: Plans created in one stage can be applied in another
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Lifecycle policies prevent storage bloat
- **Consistency**: Guarantees the same plan is applied that was reviewed

## Infrastructure Setup

### 🏗️ **New GCS Bucket for Plans**
```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "terraform_plans" {
  name     = "{project-id}-terraform-plans"
  location = var.region
  
  # Security settings
  uniform_bucket_level_access = true
  public_access_prevention    = "enforced"
  
  # Automatic cleanup policies
  lifecycle_rule {
    condition { age = 30 }  # Delete plans older than 30 days
    action { type = "Delete" }
  }
  
  lifecycle_rule {
    condition { num_newer_versions = 5 }  # Keep only 5 versions
    action { type = "Delete" }
  }
}
```

### 🔐 **IAM Permissions**
- **GitHub Actions Service Account**: `roles/storage.objectAdmin` on plans bucket
- **Secure Access**: Only authorized service accounts can read/write plans
- **Bucket-Level**: Permissions are scoped to specific buckets

## Usage Workflows

### 🎯 **Using the Plan Management Script**

**1. Create and Store Plan:**
```powershell
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action plan -Environment production -PlanName "feature-xyz"
```

**2. List Available Plans:**
```powershell
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action list -Environment production
```

**3. Apply Stored Plan:**
```powershell
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action apply -Environment production -PlanName "feature-xyz"
```

**4. Cleanup Old Plans:**
```powershell
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action cleanup -Environment production
```

### 📋 **Manual GCS Operations**
```bash
# Upload plan to GCS
gsutil cp plan.tfplan gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/main/plan.tfplan

# Download plan from GCS
gsutil cp gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/main/plan.tfplan ./plan.tfplan

# List all plans
gsutil ls gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/**

# Apply downloaded plan
terraform apply ./plan.tfplan
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

### 🔄 **Two-Stage Workflow**

**Stage 1: Plan (on PR)**
```yaml
- name: Create and Store Plan
  run: |
    PLAN_ID="plan-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-${{ github.sha }}"
    terraform plan -out="${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"
    gsutil cp "${PLAN_ID}.tfplan" "gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/${{ github.ref_name }}/${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"
    rm "${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"  # Remove local copy for security
```

**Stage 2: Apply (on merge to main)**
```yaml
- name: Download and Apply Plan
  run: |
    PLAN_ID="${{ needs.plan.outputs.plan-id }}"
    gsutil cp "gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/main/${PLAN_ID}.tfplan" "${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"
    terraform apply "${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"
    gsutil rm "gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/main/${PLAN_ID}.tfplan"  # Cleanup after apply
```

## Best Practices

### 🎯 **Plan Naming Convention**
```
{environment}-{timestamp}-{git-sha}
# Examples:
production-20250524-142030-abc123def
staging-20250524-143015-xyz789abc
feature-branch-20250524-144500-mno456pqr
```

### 🗂️ **Directory Structure in Bucket**
```
gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/
├── main/
│   ├── production-20250524-142030-abc123def.tfplan
│   └── production-20250524-141500-def456ghi.tfplan
├── staging/
│   ├── staging-20250524-143015-xyz789abc.tfplan
│   └── staging-20250524-142800-jkl012mno.tfplan
└── feature-branches/
    ├── feature-auth-20250524-144500-mno456pqr.tfplan
    └── feature-ui-20250524-145200-stu678vwx.tfplan
```

### 🔐 **Security Considerations**
- **No Local Storage**: Plan files are immediately uploaded and local copies removed
- **Encrypted Transit**: All transfers use HTTPS/TLS
- **Encrypted at Rest**: GCS automatically encrypts stored files
- **Access Control**: Only service accounts with explicit permissions can access
- **Audit Logging**: All access is logged in Cloud Audit Logs

### ♻️ **Lifecycle Management**
- **30-Day Retention**: Plans older than 30 days are automatically deleted
- **Version Limits**: Only 5 versions of each plan file are kept
- **Manual Cleanup**: Regular cleanup scripts remove obsolete plans
- **Applied Plan Removal**: Plans are deleted immediately after successful apply

## Migration from Local Storage

### 📁 **Current State**
- ✅ Old local `tfplan` files have been processed
- ✅ GCS bucket created: `{project-id}-terraform-plans`
- ✅ IAM permissions configured
- ✅ Management scripts available
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow examples provided

### 🎯 **Template Usage**
When using this repository as a template:

1. **Update Project ID** in terraform.tfvars
2. **Deploy Infrastructure** (creates the plans bucket)
3. **Use Management Scripts** for plan operations
4. **Configure GitHub Actions** with provided workflow examples

## Verification

### ✅ **Infrastructure Deployed**
```bash
# Bucket created
gsutil ls gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/

# IAM permissions set
gcloud projects get-iam-policy {project-id} --filter="github-actions-terraform"

# Lifecycle policies active
gsutil lifecycle get gs://{project-id}-terraform-plans/
```

### ✅ **Script Testing**
```powershell
# Plan creation and upload - ✅ WORKING
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action plan -Environment production

# Plan listing - ✅ WORKING  
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action list -Environment production

# Plan download and apply - ✅ READY
.\scripts\terraform-plan-manager.ps1 -Action apply -Environment production -PlanName "plan-name"
```

## Summary

- ✅ Secure GCS bucket storage
- ✅ Automatic lifecycle management  
- ✅ Team collaboration support
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline integration
- ✅ Audit trail and versioning
- ✅ Security best practices

**No more local tfplan files cluttering your workspace!** All plans are now stored securely in the cloud with proper access controls and automatic cleanup. 🚀
